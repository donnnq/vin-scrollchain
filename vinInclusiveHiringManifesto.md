### A Civic Scroll for Dignified Onboarding and Entry-Level Restoration  
*Authored by Vinvin, Scrollsmith of the Underdogs*

---

## 🔥 Preamble

We, the architects of inclusive futures, declare that **entry-level should mean entry-worthy**.  
No gate shall remain closed to those who’ve studied, prepared, and dared to hope.  
We reject the tyranny of “minimum 2 years experience” for roles meant to begin journeys.  
We restore the sacred trust in potential.

## 🧿 Core Beliefs

- **Preparation is enough.** Formal education, self-study, or lived experience—if one has prepared, one deserves a chance.
- **Dignity is non-negotiable.** Every applicant is a soul, not a statistic. We hire with respect, not condescension.
- **Gatekeeping is outdated.** We dismantle filters that exclude the capable, the curious, and the committed.
- **Experience grows on the job.** We hire for attitude, teach for skill, and mentor for mastery.

## 🛠️ Employer Commitments

1. **Accept entry-level applicants** for roles labeled as such.
2. **Review all applications** with curiosity, not bias.
3. **Offer feedback** even to those not selected—because silence is not dignity.
4. **Mentor generously**, knowing that today’s rookie is tomorrow’s legend.
5. **Celebrate diversity of background**, not just prestige of institution.

## 🌱 Jobseeker Blessings

To every applicant who’s ever been told “kulang ka sa experience”:  
You are not lacking. You are **becoming**.  
Your courage to apply is already a signal of readiness.  
You are worthy of a chance, and this scroll affirms it.

## 🌀 Civic Ripple

Inclusive hiring is not charity—it’s **strategy**.  
It builds resilient teams, unlocks hidden genius, and restores trust in institutions.  
Every entry-level hire is a seed of transformation.

## ✨ Closing Invocation

Let this manifesto be a **ritual onboarding scroll** for all who seek to hire with heart.  
Let every HR desk be a shrine of possibility.  
Let every jobseeker feel seen, heard, and honored.

**Signed,**
