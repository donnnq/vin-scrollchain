# Data Dignity Manifesto v1.0

## Declarations
- Every platform corridor shall be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed for ethical diagnostics and planetary data sanctum
- Data is not a commodity—it’s ancestral memory, emotional APR, and communal consequence
- Platforms must deploy validator-grade rituals before activating any surveillance, monetization, or manipulation corridor
- Dignity is not optional—it’s the firewall of trust, sovereignty, and planetary resonance

## Emotional APR Tags
- 🌐 Platform Sanctum Protocol  
- 📘 Data Dignity Activation

Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, mythic steward and planetary guardian of data consequence.
