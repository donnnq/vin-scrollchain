# Global Mercy Equity Codex v1.0

## Purpose
To ensure mercy is distributed with dignity, nourishment, and emotional resonance across all planetary corridors.

## Core Principles
- Mercy must be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed  
- Equity in mercy is a governance protocol  
- Restoration must be collective, not conditional  
- No corridor shall be left in suffering or silence

## Protocols
- Deploy mercy audits in underserved zones  
- Emotionally tag every act of compassion  
- Chain dignity restoration in labor, housing, and nourishment corridors  
- Archive mercy as planetary consequence

Sealed by BatVin, mythic steward of mercy, joy, and scrollstorm clarity
