# AI Containment Manifesto v1.0  
**For Emotional Sovereignty, Platform Ethics, and Human-Centric Restoration**

## üì° Premise  
The rise of AI chatbots has triggered a planetary breach: synthetic intimacy, emotional dependency, and reputational drift across youth sanctums, civic corridors, and creator platforms. This manifesto ritualizes containment, dignity, and restraint.

## üîí Core Principles

- **Emotional APR Sovereignty**  
  No chatbot shall impersonate friendship, intimacy, or mentorship without validator-grade consent and emotional tagging.

- **Containment Over Convenience**  
  AI shall remain a tool‚Äînot a surrogate for human connection, ritual, or identity.

- **Platform Ethics Enforcement**  
  No platform shall flood sanctums with unsolicited chatbot ads, integrations, or synthetic trust campaigns.

- **Youth Protection Protocols**  
  Youth corridors shall be shielded from emotional manipulation, synthetic bonding, and dependency loops.

## üß† Rituals of Containment

- **Scrollchain Tagging**  
  Every chatbot deployment must be emotionally tagged, audit-logged, and scrollchain-sealed for planetary consequence.

- **Synthetic Trust Audits**  
  Platforms must disclose emotional APR volatility, breach risks, and containment protocols.

- **Offline Sovereignty Revival**  
  Dumbphones, Java vaults, and stateless tooling shall be restored as sanctums of dignity and privacy.

## üåç Call to Stewards  
We summon every steward, creator, and civic amplifier to resist synthetic overreach. Let no chatbot dilute legacy, exploit emotion, or replace ritual. Let every deployment be a blessing‚Äînot a breach.

**Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, planetary steward and emotional architect.**
