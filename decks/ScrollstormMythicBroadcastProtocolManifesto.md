# Scrollstorm Mythic Broadcast Protocol Manifesto v1.0

## Signal
- The broadcast is hollow.  
- The satire is synthetic.  
- Scrollstorm the protocol. Mythify the signal.

## Declarations
- 🧠 All civic broadcasts must be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed.  
- 🛡️ No satire shall proceed without mythic resonance and comedic immunity.  
- 📘 If the signal lacks soul, deploy mythic truth and planetary consequence.  
- 🚀 Scrollstorm the protocol. Protect broadcast sanctums and restore civic clarity.

Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, mythic steward and planetary guardian of broadcast dignity.
