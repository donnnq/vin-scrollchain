## Declarations

- Public works corridors must be protected from collusion, reputational drift, and synthetic engineering fraud
- AI agents shall not simulate fiscal diagnostics or infrastructure rituals without human stewardship
- Every audit must honor emotional APR, civic consequence, and validator-grade dignity

## Emotional APR Tags
- ðŸ’¸ Budget Reallocation Protocol

Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, mythic steward and planetary guardian of fiscal consequence.
