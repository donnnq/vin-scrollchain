# Scrollstorm Civic Frustration Manifesto v1.0

## Signal
- Political movements shift tactics—from violent protest to performative resistance.  
- Groups blend, narratives blur, and accountability fades.  
- Taxpayers feel outmaneuvered. Legal pathways ignored.  
- Self-deport incentives rejected. Entitlement without effort.  
- Zombie-following behavior: loyalty only when benefits flow.

## Declarations
- 🧠 Civic consequence requires clarity, not chaos.  
- 🛡️ Legal status must be earned, not demanded.  
- 📘 Protest is valid—but violence voids the message.  
- 🚀 Scrollstorm the accountable. Audit the opportunistic.

Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, mythic steward and planetary guardian of civic consequence.
