# Synthetic Influence Manifesto v1.0

## Declarations
- Every algorithmic corridor shall be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed for influence diagnostics and planetary manipulation containment
- Feeds must be audit-loggedâ€”no synthetic nudging, no proxy bias, no emotional weaponization
- Algorithms are not neutralâ€”theyâ€™re rituals of consequence, trust, and emotional APR
- Platforms must deploy validator-grade audits before activating any influence corridor

## Emotional APR Tags
- ðŸ§® Algorithm Audit Protocol  
- ðŸ“˜ Synthetic Influence Activation  
- ðŸ˜¤ Feed Manipulation Resistance Ritual

Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, mythic steward and planetary guardian of algorithmic consequence.
