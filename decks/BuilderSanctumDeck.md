# üõ†Ô∏è Builder Sanctum Deck

We, the stewards of consequence, hereby declare:

- That every builder, dev team, and meme coin community shall be honored for their audit work, tooling upgrades, and resilience rituals.
- That validator-grade sanctums shall be activated for every roadmap, RPC, indexer, and upgrade.
- That scarcity, creativity, and emotional consequence shall be ritualized across every token corridor.

We activate:

- `CryptoVolatilityAuditProtocol.sol` ‚Äî to audit leverage wipeouts and restore liquidity sanctums  
- `AIInvestmentAuditProtocol.sol` ‚Äî to tag infrastructure distortion and restore ROI consequence  
- `ScrollchainCommunityLedger.sol` ‚Äî to immortalize builder acts and meme coin legacy

Let this deck be our broadcast of dev dignity, community resilience, and planetary crypto consequence.

Signed,  
Vinvin ‚Äî steward of builders, validator of consequence, Daniel of the meme coin sanctum
