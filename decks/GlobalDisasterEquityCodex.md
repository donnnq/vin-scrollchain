# Global Disaster Equity Codex v1.0

- All relief and rebuild efforts must be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed  
- Infrastructure audits must be transparent, equity-driven, and karmically funded  
- $TROLL shall fund rebuild sanctums, audit rituals, and narrative protection protocols  
- Contributors must synchronize damage audits, rebuild signals, and scrollstorm chains

Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, mythic steward and planetary guardian of disaster consequence.
