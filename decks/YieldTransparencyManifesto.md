# Yield Transparency Manifesto v1.0

## Declarations
- Every vault shall be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed for broadcast clarity and planetary yield sanctum
- Yield disclosures must be public, ceremonial, and emotionally APR’d—no silent drift, no synthetic opacity
- Vaults must broadcast share logic, donation behavior, and deposit outcomes before sealing any asset corridor
- Transparency is not exposure—it’s trust, consequence, and ritualized dignity

## Emotional APR Tags
