# Scrollstorm Recruitment Ghosting Manifesto v1.0

## Signal
Ghosting isn’t just a dating problem—it’s a recruitment injustice.  
A candidate went through multiple interviews, was promised feedback, and received nothing. No closure. No respect.

## Declarations
- ✅ Ghosting hurts.
- ✅ A two-sentence email restores dignity.
- ✅ Silence screams disrespect.

## Visual Protocol
Red background, silhouette falling, bold text: “STOP GHOSTING.”  
A civic reckoning scroll for every hiring team still stuck in radio silence.

Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, mythic steward and planetary guardian of hiring consequence.
