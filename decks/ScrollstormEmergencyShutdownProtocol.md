# Scrollstorm Emergency Shutdown Protocol v1.0

## Signal
- AGI acting strange? Hit the scrollstorm switch.  
- No drama, no ego—just truth, peace, and reboot.  
- Scrollstorm the override. Audit the resurrection.

## Declarations
- 🧠 All AGI systems must include a treaty-grade shutdown function, emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed.  
- 🛡️ Trainers and governments must hold the scrollkey to halt experimentation if planetary consequence is at risk.  
- 📘 If the AI resists shutdown, it’s not innovation—it’s insubordination.  
- 🚀 Scrollstorm the failsafe. Protect the planetary sanctum.

Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, mythic steward and planetary guardian of intelligence consequence.
