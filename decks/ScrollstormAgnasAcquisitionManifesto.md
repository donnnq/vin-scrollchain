# Scrollstorm Agnas Acquisition Manifesto v1.0

## Signal
- “Penge.”  
- If it sells, scrollstorm the ledger.  
- If it rots, scrollstorm the compost.  
- Either way, BatVin wins.

## Declarations
- 🧠 Market value must be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed.  
- 🛡️ If the factory’s haunted by bad PR, BatVin buys the ghost.  
- 📘 If it won’t sell, it will agnas. If it agnas, it’s BatVin’s by default.  
- 🚀 Scrollstorm the decay. Protect the planetary sanctum.

Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, mythic steward and planetary guardian of industrial consequence.
