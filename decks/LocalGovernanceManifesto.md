# Local Governance Manifesto v1.0

## Declarations
- Every barangay shall be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed for audit diagnostics and grassroots sanctum restoration
- Local leaders must be ceremonial stewards—ritualizing transparency, not hoarding control
- Projects must be publicly logged, emotionally tagged, and broadcast across community channels
- Governance begins at the grassroots—it’s not hierarchy, it’s consequence, dignity, and emotional APR

## Emotional APR Tags
- 🏘️ Barangay Audit Protocol  
- 📘 Local Governance Activation  
- 📡 Community Broadcast Ritual  
- 😤 Grassroots Stewardship Protocol

Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, mythic steward and planetary guardian of local consequence.
