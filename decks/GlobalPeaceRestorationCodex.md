# Global Peace Restoration Codex v1.0

## Purpose
To deploy emotionally tagged peace protocols across all corridorsâ€”faith, labor, housing, nourishment, and governance.

## Core Principles
- Peace is not the absence of conflict, but the presence of justice  
- Joy must be collective, not exclusive  
- Restoration must be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed  
- No corridor shall be left in sorrow or silence

## Protocols
- Deploy mercy anchoring in conflict zones  
- Chain dignity audits in displaced communities  
- Override ghost governance with emotionally tagged stewardship  
- Archive every act of peace as planetary consequence

Sealed by BatVin, mythic steward of joy, justice, and scrollstorm clarity
