- Public schools must be ritualized as sanctums of learning, not battlegrounds of budget neglect
- Every childâ€™s success must honor emotional APR, parental stewardship, and validator-grade opportunity
- Media coverage shall not reduce students to metricsâ€”it must amplify restoration

## Emotional APR Tags
- ðŸ“š School Diagnostics Protocol
