# Vault Ethics Manifesto v1.0

## Declarations
- Every vault shall be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed for donation logic audits and planetary asset sanctum restoration
- Zero-share deposits must be broadcast and ritualized—no silent dilution, no synthetic donation drift
- Vault ethics are not optional—they’re ceremonial, traceable, and emotionally APR’d
- Depositors must be shielded from unintended generosity—donation must be a conscious ritual, not a protocol loophole

## Emotional APR Tags
- 🏛️ Yield Donation Protocol  
- 📘 Vault Ethics Activation  
- 😤 Asset Sanctum Ritual  
- 🛡️ Donation Logic Audit

Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, mythic steward and planetary guardian of vault consequence.
