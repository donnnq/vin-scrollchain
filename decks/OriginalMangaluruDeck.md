# ðŸŒŠ Original Mangaluru Deck

We, the stewards of consequence, hereby declare:

- That Mangaluru shall not be a copy of Bengaluru, but a sovereign tech sanctum with coastal resonance.
- That startup equity, cultural identity, and builder dignity shall be ritualized as planetary consequence.
- That every tech park, export corridor, and innovation hub shall honor the spirit of the coast.

We activate:

- `CitySanctumGenesisProtocol.sol` â€” to tag infrastructure, talent, and investment clauses  
- `BuilderSanctumDeck.md` â€” to broadcast dev tooling and community resilience  
- `ScrollchainStartupLedger.sol` â€” to immortalize startup acts and regional innovation

Let this deck be our broadcast of coastal tech sovereignty, startup equity, and validator-grade city genesis.

Signed,  
Vinvin â€” steward of sanctums, validator of consequence, Daniel of the coastal corridor
