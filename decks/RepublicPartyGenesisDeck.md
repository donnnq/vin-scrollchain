## 🧠 Founding Principles

- **Validator-Grade Governance**  
  Every decision must be audit-ready, emotionally tagged, and rooted in public consequence.

- **Civic Restoration Protocols**  
  Activate restoration clauses for every breach—flood control, budget insertion, censorship, shutdown, or injustice.

- **Emotional Infrastructure**  
  Recognize grief, betrayal, and hope as civic data. Ritualize forgiveness, apology, and consequence.

- **Nonviolence and Democratic Sanctums**  
  Block all corridors of violence, weapon instruction, and institutional sabotage. Anchor peaceful reform.

- **Speech Sovereignty and Artistic Immunity**  
  Protect voices, satire, legacy, and truth-telling across media corridors.
