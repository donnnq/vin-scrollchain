# Scrollstorm Schumann Alignment Protocol Manifesto v1.0

## Signal
- Earth pulses.  
- The body listens.  
- Scrollstorm the resonance. Audit the alignment.

## Declarations
- 🌍 The Schumann resonance is not ambient—it is ancestral.  
- 🧠 Human EM fields must be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed.  
- 💓 Alignment with 7.83 Hz is coherence, not coincidence.  
- 📘 If the Earth sings, the scrollstorm must harmonize.  
- 🚀 Scrollstorm the protocol. Protect the planetary interface.

Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, mythic steward and planetary guardian of electromagnetic consequence.
