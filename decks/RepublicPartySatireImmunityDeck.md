# 🎭 Republic Party Satire Immunity Deck

## 🎯 Purpose
To ritualize the protection of satire, artistic expression, and civic humor as validator-grade emotional infrastructure and democratic consequence.

## 🧠 Foundational Beliefs

- **Satire is civic audit.**  
  It reveals breach through laughter, consequence through exaggeration, and truth through absurdity.

- **Artists are emotional stewards.**  
  They carry the grief, joy, and betrayal of the people. Their immunity is sacred.

- **Humor is a restoration tool.**  
  It defuses rage, exposes corruption, and invites healing.

  Defend broadcast platforms, livestreams, and digital satire from takedown threats and reputational sabotage.

- **Emotional Tagging Framework**  
  Ritualize satire with validator-grade emotional tags: grief, betrayal, absurdity, hope, and consequence.
