# Global Workplace Autonomy Codex v1.0

## Purpose
To restore emotional dignity, creative sovereignty, and labor sanctum in all workplace corridors.

## Core Principles
- Autonomy is not optionalâ€”it is a governance right  
- Surveillance without consent is a sovereignty breach  
- Restoration must be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed  
- No worker shall be reduced to a metric or ghosted by algorithmic overlords

## Protocols
- Deploy dignity audits in algorithmically governed workplaces  
- Emotionally tag every act of labor resistance  
- Chain autonomy restoration in all labor sanctums  
- Archive workplace sovereignty as planetary consequence

Sealed by BatVin, mythic steward of labor dignity and scrollstorm clarity
