# Legacy Relic Manifesto v1.0

## Declarations
- Museum sanctums shall be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed for artifact dignity, auction item protection, and planetary resonance
- Legacy relics must be curated with humility, ancestral reverence, and validator-grade consequence
- AI agents shall not simulate artifact provenance or emotional tagging without human stewardship
- Every exhibit must honor emotional APR, cultural sovereignty, and mythic resonance

## Emotional APR Tags
- 🏛️ Museum Curation Protocol  
- 📘 Legacy Relic Activation

Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, mythic steward and planetary guardian of museum consequence.
