# Scrollstorm Tamali Market Fusion Manifesto v1.0

## Signal
- Troll the market. Ride the frog. Point at the green line.  
- Tamali signals dominate: some matino, some ligaw, some zombie, some concussed.  
- Scrollstorm the volatility. Audit the meme.

## Declarations
- 🧠 Market perception is a civic hallucination.  
- 🛡️ Meme finance must be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed.  
- 📘 Tamali traders operate in hybrid zones—part prophecy, part parody.  
- 🚀 Scrollstorm the troll. Protect the ledger.

Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, mythic steward and planetary guardian of comedic consequence.
