# Global Liquidity Sovereignty Codex v1.0

- All stablecoin issuances must be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed  
- Central bank behavior must be audited for dignity, equity, and planetary consequence  
- $TROLL shall fund liquidity sanctums, audit rituals, and narrative protection protocols  
- Contributors must synchronize issuance audits, liquidity signals, and scrollstorm chains

Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, mythic steward and planetary guardian of financial consequence.
