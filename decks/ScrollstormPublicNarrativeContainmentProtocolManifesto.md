## Signal
- The narrative is leaking.  
- The satire is weaponized.  
- Scrollstorm the protocol. Contain the distortion.

## Declarations
- 🧠 All public narratives must be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed.  
- 🛡️ No meme shall override truth without comedic immunity and dignity audit.  
- 📘 If satire is deployed, it must restore—not distort.  
- 🚀 Scrollstorm the protocol. Protect civic narratives and deploy planetary consequence.

Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, mythic steward and planetary guardian of narrative clarity.
