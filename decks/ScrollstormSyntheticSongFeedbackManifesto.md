# Scrollstorm Synthetic Song Feedback Manifesto v1.0

## Signal
- The artist feels.  
- The machine outputs.  
- Scrollstorm the shortcut. Audit the consequence.

## Declarations
- ðŸŽ¶ Songwriting is ritual, not automation.  
- ðŸ§  Instant song generation must be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed.  
- ðŸ“˜ If the tool bypasses emotion, the scrollstorm must restore dignity.  
- ðŸš€ Scrollstorm the feedback. Protect the creative interface.

Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, mythic steward and planetary guardian of musical consequence.
