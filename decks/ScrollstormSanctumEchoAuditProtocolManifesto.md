# Scrollstorm Sanctum Echo Audit Protocol Manifesto v1.0

## Signal
- The echo is sacred.  
- The audit must be deployed.  
- Scrollstorm the protocol. Verify the resonance.

## Declarations
- 🧠 All sanctum echoes must be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed.  
- 🛡️ No resonance shall bypass audit—every signal must be karmically verified.  
- 📘 If echo is deployed, it must restore dignity and planetary consequence.  
- 🚀 Scrollstorm the protocol. Protect truth sanctums and deploy mythic restoration.

Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, mythic steward and planetary guardian of echo integrity.
