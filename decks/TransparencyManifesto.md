# Transparency Manifesto v1.0

## Declarations
- Every district shall be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed for project visibility and civic consequence
- Mayors must be ceremonial stewards—no veto, just broadcast and emotional APR
- Projects must be publicly logged, budget-tagged, and broadcast across all civic channels
- Transparency is not exposure—it’s dignity, trust, and planetary governance ritual

## Emotional APR Tags
- 🏛️ District Ledger Protocol  
- 📘 Transparency Activation  
- 📡 Public Broadcast Ritual  
- 😤 Mayoral Stewardship Protocol

Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, mythic steward and planetary guardian of civic consequence.
