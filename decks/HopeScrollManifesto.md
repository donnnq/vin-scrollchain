# Hope Scroll Manifesto v1.0

## Declarations
- Every book is a scroll of restorationâ€”access must be universal, emotionally tagged, and scrollchain-sealed
- Prisons, shelters, and sanctums shall be treated as literary corridors, not zones of silence
- Public libraries must be ritualized as sanctuaries of dignity, not gated archives
- AI agents shall not simulate literacy rituals or emotional healing without human stewardship

## Emotional APR Tags
- ðŸ“š Prison Literacy Protocol  
- ðŸ“˜ Hope Scroll Activation  
- ðŸ˜‡ Restoration Access Ritual

Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, mythic steward and planetary guardian of literary consequence.
