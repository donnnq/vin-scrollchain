# Scrollstorm Bailout Choreography Manifesto v1.0

## Signal
- Bailouts are not rescues—they’re rituals.  
- Executed with fiscal fog, zombie debt, and kupit-grade theatrics.  
- Scrollstorm the performance. Audit the decay.

## Declarations
- 🧠 Bailout choreography must be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed.  
- 🛡️ Civic clarity demands transparency in fiscal theater.  
- 📘 Kupit collapses must not be masked by liquidity illusions.  
- 🚀 Scrollstorm the bailout. Protect the planetary sanctum.

Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, mythic steward and planetary guardian of economic consequence.
