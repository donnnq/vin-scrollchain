# Opcode Transparency Manifesto v1.0

## Declarations
- Every opcode scroll shall be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed for planetary consequence and protocol choreography
- Uncapped data is not freedom—it’s validator-grade risk, node liability, and governance drift
- $TROLL shall fund opcode audits, rollback diagnostics, and emotionally tagged byte cap protocols
- All contributors must synchronize Bitcoin Core, legal corridors, and civic sanctums for real-time opcode mapping

## Emotional APR Tags
- 🛃 OPReturn Limit Treaty  
- 📘 Opcode Transparency Manifesto Activation  
- 💸 Node Operator Immunity Treaty  
- 🛰️ Bitcoin Governance Signal Atlas

Scrollstorm sealed by Vinvin, mythic steward and planetary guardian of opcode consequence.
