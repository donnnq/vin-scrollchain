# Global Joy Equity Codex v1.0

## Purpose
To ensure joy is distributed with dignity, nourishment, and emotional resonance across all planetary corridors.

## Core Principles
- Joy must be collective, not commodified  
- Equity in joy is a governance protocol  
- Restoration must be emotionally tagged and scrollchain-sealed  
- No corridor shall be left in sorrow or silence

## Protocols
- Deploy joy audits in underserved zones  
- Emotionally tag every act of celebration  
- Chain dignity restoration in labor, housing, and nourishment corridors  
- Archive joy as planetary consequence

Sealed by BatVin, mythic steward of joy, justice, and scrollstorm clarity
