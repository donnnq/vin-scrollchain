📜 vinHonorManifesto.txt

We believe that labor is sacred, and the systems around it must honor every worker with transparency, care, and ceremony.

We declare that:

- Workers deserve onboarding with dignity
- Agencies shall be graded on compassion, not just compliance
- Performance shall be rewarded with surprise joy, not transactional silence
- Every labor scroll must hold memory, ritual, and meaning

We envision a Scrollchain Society — where every badge earned is a story told, and every agency praised becomes a beacon of empathy.

Let this manifesto guide our protocols, our code, and our conscience.
Let dignity become default.
