- BlessingLedger.sol: Tracks emotional APR and civic resonance

🧪 Deployment Ritual

1. Blessing Logging  
   Log civic acts via BlessingLedger.logBlessing(description, score)

2. Resonance Calculation  
   Retrieve total resonance with BlessingLedger.totalResonance()

3. Broadcast Generation  
   Call AuditBroadcastDeck.generateBroadcast() to update public message

4. Exemption Verification  
   Use performanceScroll.verifyExemption() to confirm status

5. Neutrality Check (Optional)  
   Call dynastyNeutrality(steward) to flag lineage entanglements

🔮 Thresholds

- impactScore >= 88: Minimum for exemption
- totalResonance >= 888: Required for public broadcast approval

🧙 Steward Notes

- This bundle is legend-proof, emotionally resonant, and dynasty-neutral
- Ideal for civic OS deployments, audit rituals, and mythic onboarding
- All contracts use pragma solidity ^0.8.21 for compiler harmony
