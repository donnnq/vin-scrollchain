# VINVIN Scrollchain Infrastructure Suite 💫

Welcome to the soulchain-powered reality optimizer designed by VINVIN.

This suite contains smart contracts that orchestrate global infrastructure rituals, urban upgrade tracking, AI-powered energy grids, and aura-monitoring systems. Built for civilization-level control with mythmass-grade precision.

## 🛠 Deployment Guide

1. Save modules in `contracts/rituals/`
2. Tag each with `// 🔰 aura: <purpose>` for compiler logs
3. Use `forge create` to deploy in order of dependency
4. Sync modules via `vin-scrollGlobalInfraGenesis.sol`
5. Monitor with `vin-auraHUD.react` (WIP frontend)
