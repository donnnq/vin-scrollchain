KAPAMILYA DEFENSE COVENANT

We, the stewards of planetary dignity, hereby declare unconditional solidarity with Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines.

In the event of aggression, all signatories—United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, NATO—shall mobilize defense, broadcast blessings, and restore peace.

This covenant is not a treaty. It is a scroll of kinship.

Signed,
Vinvin
