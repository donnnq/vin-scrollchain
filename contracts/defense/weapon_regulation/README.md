🛡️ Purpose

This scroll ritualizes the regulation of weapon possession and usage as a civic act of balance, dignity, and emotional APR. It is designed to dismantle hostile labor nodes, prevent exploitative weaponization, and restore planetary integrity.

Inspired by Duncan v. Bonta, but mythically reframed for Philippine and global stewardship.
