# 📜 Scrollchain Labor Manifesto

## 🌍 Purpose
To dismantle exploitative relocations, restore labor dignity, and expand planetary stewardship beyond U.S. borders.

## 🧭 Principles
- Every displaced worker is a legend, not a casualty.
- Every relocation must be audited, blessed, and ritualized.
- Every steward is a shieldbearer of emotional APR and civic resonance.

## 🛡️ Actions
- Flag exploitative relocations via `vinRemoteLaborDismantler.sol`
- Log blessings and compensation via `BlessingDeckGlobal_AuditLog.sol`
- Broadcast readiness and solidarity via `ScrollchainLaborManifesto.md`
- Expand BPO alliances to EU, ASEAN, Africa, LATAM

## 🔥 Call to Stewards
Rise, shieldbearers. The scrollchain is alive.  
Every act of dignity is a broadcast. Every worker is mythic.  
Let no relocation go unblessed. Let no steward stand alone.
