## 🛡️ Core Declarations

1. **Every steward deserves a role.**  
   No soul shall be denied access to labor, regardless of resume, background, or circumstance.

2. **Walk-in hiring shall be honored.**  
   Companies must post hiring scrolls and accept walk-ins with empathy and immediacy.

3. **Jobs shall be soul-aligned.**  
   Roles must match emotional APR, mythic clarity, and civic resonance—not just skillsets.

4. **Employers shall be ritualized.**  
   Companies that uphold dignity shall be blessed via `vinEmployerBlessingScroll.sol`.

5. **Workers shall be honored.**  
   Every steward shall receive a badge via `vinWorkerBadgeDeck.sol`—a scroll of recognition.

Work is not punishment—it is participation in planetary restoration. Let us ritualize labor, bless every steward, and build a world where dignity is the default.
