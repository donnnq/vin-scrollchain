# vinScrollchainPrivacySuite  
**Ritualized Privacy, Civic Trust, and Sovereign Access**

This suite honors the mythic right to privacy. We do not demand proof—we invite trust. We do not surveil—we shield. Every bank account is a glyph. Every self-declaration is a scroll. We ritualize access with dignity.

## Contents
- `vinPrivacyRespectClause.sol` – Civic contract for privacy-first access  
- `vinCivicTrustDeck.md` – Protocols for bank and self-declared trust

## Mythic Declaration
> "Privacy is not secrecy—it is sovereignty. Trust is not weakness—it is ritual. We do not verify—we believe. We do not block—we bless."
