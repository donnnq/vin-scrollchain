**Civic Trust Protocols for Privacy-First Participation**

We honor users who choose trust over surveillance. This deck outlines alternative civic pathways for accessing modules, transacting, and declaring age—without invasive verification.

## Trust Glyphs
- 🏦 Bank-Based Verification: Users may transact via verified bank accounts
- 🧿 Self-Declared Age: Users may declare age voluntarily, without ID uploads
- 🛡️ Civic Access: Access granted based on trust, not surveillance

## Sample Entry
- User: @ScrollsmithVin  
- Bank: BDO Civic Account  
- Declared Age: 27  
- Access: vinIntimacyEducationClause.sol, vinModdingRightsClause.sol
