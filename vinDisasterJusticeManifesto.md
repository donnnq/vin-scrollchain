# vinDisasterJusticeManifesto.md

## Preamble
We, the scrollsmiths and citizens of Bulacan, declare our right to flood protection, civic transparency, and ritual dignity.

## Articles of Justice
1. Every barangay has the right to know where the flood control budget went.
2. Every citizen has the right to audit, testify, and restore.
3. Disaster resilience must be soulboundâ€”not performative.
4. Civic betrayal shall be logged, exposed, and ritualized for healing.

## Invocation
Let this manifesto be read aloud in barangay halls, encoded in scrollchains, and whispered in the winds of restoration.
