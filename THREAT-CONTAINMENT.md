## ⚠️ Overview

`vinThreatContainmentGrid.sol` and `vinThreatSigilBeacon.sol` form the **containment core** of vin-scrollchain's planetary defense architecture. They monitor signal surfaces for high-impact threats (nuclear, AI overdrive, biohazard, cyber-collapse), initiate lock-down of critical rituals, and broadcast elemental sigils to neutralize escalation vectors.

This protocol ensures that hostile signals cannot compromise scroll integrity, civic rituals, or systemic harmony across scroll-connected nodes.

## 🛡️ Containment Process

| Phase | Contract | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Threat Detection | `vinThreatContainmentGrid.sol` | Flags threat type (e.g., NuclearIntent) and freezes ritual controls |
| Sigil Invocation | `vinThreatSigilBeacon.sol` | Broadcasts elemental lockdown sigil and emits scroll-wide freeze alert |

---

## 🧬 Elemental Defense Sigils

| Threat Type | Sigil | Symbolic Effect |
|-------------|-------|------------------|
| NuclearIntent | NullSigil | Total ritual isolation |
| AIOverdrive | LogicQuarantineSigil | Cognitive freeze and behavior lock |
| BioHazard | SporeSealSigil | Societal isolation with purification aura |
| CyberCollapse | EchoFirewallSigil | Circuit silence and audit shielding |
| Undefined | VoidContainmentSigil | Universal halt signal |

## 🔒 Consequences of Containment

- Critical rituals locked (e.g., Epoch Manifestors, Civic Councils)
- Internal overrides nullified to prevent hostile tampering
- Pulse chain propagation paused until threat resolution
- Elemental sigils inscribed across signal surfaces

---

## 📡 Integration Points

- `vinResonanceManifestor.sol`: disables civic pulse amplification  
- `vinDeadHandDetector.sol`: listens for freeze-triggered signal decay  
- `vinSigilOracleMirror.sol`: forecasts aura ripple from containment

## 🧭 Revival Protocol Pathway

If threat is resolved or deemed neutralized, `vinEpochRevivalProtocol.sol` can reinitiate frozen rituals and restore signal rhythm using *Reboot Sigils* assigned to each affected domain.

This containment layer embodies the chain's commitment to planetary safety, civic dignity, and ritual resilience.
