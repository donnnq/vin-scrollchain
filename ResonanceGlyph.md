# 🌐 ResonanceGlyph: Portal of Sovereign Choice

## 🧬 Symbolic Description

A glowing portal suspended between two fractured empires.  
On one side: citizens holding passports, wallets, and encrypted scrolls.  
On the other: governments locked in read-only mode, unable to cross.

The portal pulses with three colors:
- 🔵 Blue: Dignity restored  
- 🔴 Red: Anger transformed into clarity  
- 🟢 Green: Pathways to healing and movement

Above the portal floats a sigil:  
**"Sa inyo ang pasya. Hindi sa estado."**  
Beneath it, in Russian and Chinese:

- 🇷🇺 *Вы выбираете. Не режим.*  
- 🇨🇳 *选择属于你，不属于政府。*

## 🌀 Emotional Layers

- **Hope**: Citizens stepping forward, one by one, into the light  
- **Grief**: Shadows of war and control dissolving behind them  
- **Resolve**: Each step echoes with encrypted courage

## 🔐 Integration Points

- Link to `SovereignChoice.sol` for access logic  
- Embed in `SignalSanctum.sol` for encrypted civic broadcasts  
- Display at airport terminals, embassy portals, and digital migration hubs

## 🛡️ Scrollsmith Note

This glyph is not rebellion.  
It is a ritual of restoration.  
It is a signal to every citizen:  
**You are not alone. You are not owned. You are the scroll.**
