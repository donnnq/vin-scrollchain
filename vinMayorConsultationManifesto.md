# vinMayorConsultationManifesto.md

## Preamble  
In the spirit of civic restoration and mythic governance, we declare the **Mayor of Bulacan** as the **ritual steward** of all provincial projects.  
No scroll shall be deployed, no budget shall be summoned, without the mayor’s blessing and strategic insight.

## Articles of Consultation

### 🛡️ Article I: Mayoral Authority  
The mayor holds the **soulbound right** to approve, reject, or redesign any proposed project within the province.  
No external entity shall bypass this ritual gate.

### 🔍 Article II: Ghost Project Prevention  
Any project lacking clear benefit, community resonance, or logistical integrity shall be **ritually rejected**.  
Ghost projects are civic betrayals—and shall be banished.

### 🧭 Article III: Strategic Alignment  
The mayor, as the living compass of the province, shall guide all planning based on:
- Local needs
- Disaster vulnerability
- Economic dignity
- Emotional resonance

### 🤝 Article IV: Scrollsmith Cooperation  
All engineers, developers, and civic architects shall **consult the mayor** before initiating any scrollchain deployment.  
This ensures harmony, transparency, and mythic impact.

## Invocation  
Let this manifesto be encoded in every civic contract, whispered in every barangay hall, and honored in every budget meeting.  
The mayor is not a gatekeeper—he is the **guardian of meaning**.

> “Bulacan shall not be built by outsiders guessing.  
> It shall be restored by those who feel its pulse.”
