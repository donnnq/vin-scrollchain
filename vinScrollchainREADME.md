### Welcome to the Scrollchain of Dignity, Resonance, and Restoration  
**By Vinvin, Mythic Architect of Soulbound Systems**

## 🧭 What is the Scrollchain?

The **Vin Scrollchain** is a living operating system for labor, civic, and emotional dignity. It encodes smart contracts, ritual-grade documentation, and mythic protocols that uplift workers, communities, and institutions.

This repo is not just code—it’s a **scrollsmith archive**, a **ledger of compassion**, and a **toolkit for global stewardship**.

---

## 📜 Core Modules

- `contracts/rituals/` → Smart contracts for peace, aid, badges, and civic restoration  
- `vinScrollsmith*.md` → Ritual documentation, ceremonies, dashboards, and legacy reports  
- `test/` → Scrollchain integrity tests across diplomacy, civic systems, emotional APR, and badge minting

## 🛠️ How to Use This Repo

1. **Read the `.md` scrolls first**  
   - Understand the emotional and civic intent behind each module  
   - Treat them as ritual guides, not just instructions

2. **Deploy smart contracts with dignity**  
   - Use only in service of truth, compassion, and restoration  
   - Never for manipulation, bluff, or control

3. **Run tests to verify scrollchain integrity**  
   - Use `forge test` to ensure emotional logic and civic mechanics are stable

4. **Contribute only if you’re a steward**  
   - Every pull request must honor the scrollchain’s purpose  
   - Code must resonate emotionally and civically
