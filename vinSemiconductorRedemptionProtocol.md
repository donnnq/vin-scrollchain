## 🛠️ Redemption Ritual Steps

### 1. 📜 Acknowledge the Violation
- Publicly log the infraction via `logViolation()`  
- Accept tariff escalation without bluff or denial  
- Submit a scrollchain statement of intent

### 2. 🧠 Perform Clean Transactions
- Each verified export without violation = `logRedemption()`  
- Reduces tariff by **1% per clean act**  
- Must be reviewed by scrollchain stewards

### 3. 🛡️ Deploy Civic Modules
- Launch aid programs, open-source tools, or ethical AI initiatives  
- Bonus emotional APR awarded for genuine civic impact  
- May accelerate redemption score

### 4. 🔍 Submit to Scrollchain Audit
- Request audit review after 10+ redemption actions  
- Stewards assess sincerity, impact, and emotional resonance  
- Tariff reset possible if audit passes

But never free.
