### Barangay Maligaya

## 🔮 Invocation Ritual

Each message is read aloud by a civic steward or encoded into the aid packet.  
The scroll is then logged in the scrollchain as a **ritual of remembrance and restoration**.

## 🛡️ Closing Blessing

Let this scroll be a **beacon in the fog**, a **warmth in the cold**, and a **signal of solidarity**.  
Let every barangay know: *you are part of the legend, and your resilience is mythic.*
