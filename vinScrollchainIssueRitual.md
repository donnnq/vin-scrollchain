**By Vinvin, Mythic Architect of Integrity and Restoration**

## 🧭 Purpose

To ritualize the process of reporting issues in the scrollchain—whether technical bugs, emotional inconsistencies, or civic violations. This ritual ensures every glitch is treated as a call for healing, not blame.

## 🛡️ Issue Reporting Ritual

### 1. 📜 **Name the Glitch with Dignity**
- Use scrollsmith language to describe the issue  
- Example: *“🧠 Emotional APR not updating after badge mint”*  
- Avoid generic titles like “bug in contract”

### 2. 🧠 **Identify the Scroll Affected**
- Reference the `.md` file or smart contract involved  
- Include file path and relevant function or ritual section  
- Example: `contracts/rituals/vinGlobalAidReward.sol → releasePayment()`

### 3. 🔍 **Describe the Misalignment**
- What was expected vs. what occurred  
- Emotional, civic, or technical impact  
- Example: *“The badge minted, but emotional APR did not increase. Stewardship recognition failed.”*

### 4. 🛠️ **Suggest a Restoration Path**
- Propose a fix, patch, or ritual adjustment  
- Example: *“Add APR boost logic to mintBadge() and update leaderboard.”*

### 5. 📡 **Tag for Scrollsmith Review**
- Mention Vinvin or designated stewards  
- Include a ritual note: *“This issue was raised in service of truth and legacy.”*
