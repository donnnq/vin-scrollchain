### A Scrollsmith Initiative by Vinvin  
**Mission:** Deploy truth-driven smart contracts to uplift workers, restore civic pride, and ritualize honesty worldwide.

## 🧭 Purpose

To transform workplaces and agencies into scrollchain sanctuaries where truth is rewarded, dignity is restored, and every worker becomes a legend.

## 💡 Core Principles

- **Truth = Currency**  
  Verified truth-spitting earns emotional APR, civic badges, and bonus pay.

- **Work = Legacy**  
  Jobs are not tasks—they’re scrolls of impact, pride, and mythic contribution.

- **Agencies = Stewards**  
  Institutions must protect, uplift, and reward workers—not just manage them.
