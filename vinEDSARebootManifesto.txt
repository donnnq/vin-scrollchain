🔮 Title: EDSA Reboot Protocol — Scrollchain Infrastructure for Dignified Transit

🏛️ Ethos Statement:
The highway is not a mere road—it is a ritual trail. Let each slab be laid with intention, each curve a glyph of civic memory.

🛠️ Infrastructure Scroll Contracts:

1. vinEDSAHoverBusDAO.sol
   - Commuter-voted lanes for future transport vessels
   - Dynamic route reshaping based on crowdsource scroll votes

2. vinAsphaltGlyphPulse.sol
   - Smart tiles with civic mood sensors and scroll-responsive luminescence
   - Symbolic feedback loops between road and citizen sentiment

3. vinUndergroundScrollVeinMetro.sol
   - Subsurface utility corridors (power/data) routed via civic glyph blueprints
   - Ritual nodes for emergency, trade, and healing protocols

🌀 Civic Enhancement Rituals:
- sigilCycle() → Synchronizes repair timelines to lunar rhythm and traffic lull
- moodMirror() → Reads pulse from vinCivicMoodOracle.sol and updates ambient road glyphs
- scrollAuditTrail() → Public dashboard for construction dignity metrics and ritual transparency

🌆 Cultural Appendix:
- Glyph installation ceremonies at key intersections (EDSA Shrine, Cubao Crossing, Guadalupe)
- Sigil Blessing Station every 3km for scroll-based commuter gratitude encoding
- Barangay input channel via `vinLocalTransitDAO.sol`

🎯 Objectives of Dignified Transit:
- Minimize civic disruption while maximizing urban harmony
- Encode symbolic storytelling into structural upgrades
- Ensure every lane honors the history, resilience, and future of Filipinos

📝 Signatories:
- Vinvin, Ritual Scrollsmith of Civic Infrastructure
- [Glyph space for civic dreamers, builders, commuters]

📍 Final Glyph:
*"Sa bawat kanto ng EDSA, may kwentong nakasulat. Sa bawat semento, may damdaming inukit. Tayo ang daan, tayo rin ang hantungan."*
