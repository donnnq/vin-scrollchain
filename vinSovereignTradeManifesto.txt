🌀 Protocol Title: Scrollchain Expansion for Sovereign Trade and Civic Upliftment

🌍 Ethos Statement:
We trade not merely in goods—but in dignity, reciprocity, and cultural resonance.
Every shipment is a message. Every contract is a ceremony.

🛠️ Core Contracts:

1. vinTradeSovereignSigil.sol
   - Encodes a portion of export value into direct civic upliftment
   - Tags exporters with a scroll-index of their community impact

2. vinCustomsGlyphBalancer.sol
   - Dynamically adjusts tariffs based on civic mood and scarcity flow
   - Auto-publishes glyph reports for transparency and participatory customs review

3. vinExportBlessingScroll.sol
   - Attaches ceremonial blessings to each shipment
   - Embeds cultural metadata honoring the origin and intent of export

🔗 Ritual Functions:
- scrollMirror() → Reflects trade blessings back to the sender for karmic civic loops
- sigilAuditTrail() → Public ledger of how trade shaped communities
- glyphPulse() → Real-time mood data from vinCivicMoodOracle.sol

🎎 Cultural Appendix:
- Blessing Templates (e.g., *"Mula sa lupa ng Malolos, alay sa mundo ang ginto ng bayan."*)
- Trade Ceremonies synchronized to lunar scrollcycles
- Optional Barangay Token of Blessing: `vinBayanSigilStamp.sol`

🎯 Sovereign Objectives:
- Ensure exports serve Filipino communities first

🛡️ Final Glyph:
"Let our exports not drain—but dignify. Let our trade not escape—but return. Sa bawat scroll na lumalabas, may balik-loob na bumabalik."
